# Forge: a neural network toolkit for Metal

**Forge** is a collection of helper code that makes it a little easier to construct deep neural networks using Apple's MPSCNN framework.

[Read the blog post](http://machinethink.net/blog/forge-neural-network-toolkit-for-metal/)

## What does this do?

Features of Forge:

**Conversion functions.** MPSCNN uses `MPSImage`s and `MTLTexture`s for everything, often using 16-bit floats. But you probably want to work with Swift `[Float]` arrays. Forge's conversion functions make it easy to work with Metal images and textures.

**Easy layer creation.** Reduce the boilerplate when building the layers for your neural network. Forge's domain-specific language makes defining a neural net as simple as:

```swift
let input = Input()

let output = input
        --> Resize(width: 28, height: 28)
        --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 20, activation: relu, name: "conv1")
        --> MaxPooling(kernel: (2, 2), stride: (2, 2))
        --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 50, activation: relu, name: "conv2")
        --> MaxPooling(kernel: (2, 2), stride: (2, 2))
        --> Dense(neurons: 320, activation: relu, name: "fc1")
        --> Dense(neurons: 10, name: "fc2")
        --> Softmax()

let model = Model(input: input, output: output)
```

**Custom layers.** MPSCNN only supports a limited number of layers, so we've added a few of our own:

- Depth-wise convolution
- Transpose channels
- Deconvolution (coming soon!)

**Preprocessing kernels.** Often you need to preprocess data before it goes into the neural network. Forge comes with a few handy kernels for this:

- SubtractMeanColor
- RGB2Gray
- RGB2BGR
	
**Custom compute kernels.** Many neural networks require custom compute kernels, so Forge provides helpers that make it easy to write and launch your own kernels.

**Debugging tools.** When you implement a neural network in Metal you want to make sure it actually computes the correct thing. Due to the way Metal encodes the data, inspecting the contents of the `MTLTexture` objects is not always straightforward. Forge can help with this.

**Example projects.** Forge comes with a number of pretrained neural networks, such as LeNet-5 on MNIST, Inception3 on ImageNet, and MobileNets.

## Run the demo!

To see a demo of Forge in action, open **Forge.xcworkspace** in Xcode and run the **Inception** app on your device.

You need at least Xcode 8.3 and a device with an A8 processor (iPhone 6 or better) running iOS 10 or later. You cannot build for the simulator as it does not support Metal.

## How to install Forge

Use Xcode 8.3 or better.

1. Copy the **Forge** folder into your project.
2. Use **File > Add Files to "YourProject" > Forge.xcodeproj** to add the Forge project inside your own project.
3. Drag **Products/Forge.framework** into the **Embedded Binaries** section of your project settings.
4. `import Forge` in your code.

NOTE: You cannot build for the simulator, only for "Generic iOS Device" or an actual device with arm64 architecture.

## Creating a model with Forge

Forge's domain-specific language (DSL) allows you to specify your neural network in just a few lines of code.

The steps to define your model are:

1. Define an `Input` tensor.
2. Create layers and connect them.
3. Instantiate a `Model` and compile it.

### The Input tensor

A *tensor* describes data. It's really just a fancy word for multidimensional array. Because we're using MPSCNN, our tensors use an `MPSImage` or `MPSTemporaryImage` to store their data (there are also tensors that write into the `MPSImage` belonging to another tensor).

You always start by declaring an `Input` tensor:

```
let input = Input()
```

Or like so:

```
let input = Input(width: 100, height: 100, channels: 3)
```

Tensors have a *shape*, which describes their width, height, and number of feature channels (also called depth).

When you declare the `Input` tensor without any parameters, as in the first example, it has an unknown shape. That means it will accept an image of any width, height, and depth. This is usually how you want to set up things.

In the second example, the `Input` has a fixed shape and will only accept images with those dimensions.

Most layers require their inputs to have a known size. As the data flows through your neural network, at some point it will encounter a layer that requires the tensor to have a specific shape. If any parts of the tensor's shape are still undefined at that point, Forge will give an error.

This is why the `Input` from the first example should be followed by a `Resize` layer (or a `Custom` layer) that scales the image to a specific width and height (and depth).

### Layers

A layer takes a tensor, performs some kind of computation on the data, and outputs a new tensor.

You can declare a layer like this:

```
let sigmoid = MPSCNNNeuronSigmoid(device: device)
let layer = Dense(neurons: 100, activation: sigmoid, name: "dense1")
```

This creates a new fully-connected -- or "dense" -- layer with 100 neurons and sigmoid activation (provided by an `MPSCNNNeuron` object). The name `"dense1"` is used to load the parameters for this layer.

To get the output of the layer, you apply the layer to the input tensor:

```
let output = input --> layer
```

The `-->` is a custom operator that makes it easy to connect tensors and layers. Here, `output` is a new tensor.

One way to create the model is in separate steps:

```
let input = Input()

let layer1 = Resize(width: 28, height: 28)
let layer2 = Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 20, activation: relu, name: "conv1")
let layer3 = Dense(neurons: 10, name: "dense1")
let layer4 = Softmax()

var x: Tensor
x = input --> layer1
x = x --> layer2
x = x --> layer3
x = x --> layer4
``` 

But more typically, you'd create your model by connecting all the tensors and layers in one go:

```
let input = Input()

let output = input
         --> Resize(width: 28, height: 28)
		 --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 20, activation: relu, name: "conv1")
		 --> Dense(neurons: 10, name: "dense1")
		 --> Softmax()
```

The nice thing about this mini-language is that it automatically infers the size of the data as it flows through the network. With the possible exception of the `Input` tensor, you never have to specify how large the tensors are. (You can see these inferred sizes with `print(model.summary())` after you've compiled the model.)

Sometimes it's useful to keep track of a specific layer or tensor. In that case you'd store a reference to these objects somewhere:

```
let resizeLayer: Resize
let conv1Output: Tensor
. . .

let input = Input()

resizeLayer = Resize(width: 28, height: 28)

conv1Output = input 
         --> resizeLayer 
         --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 20, activation: relu, name: "conv1")

let output = conv1Output 
         --> Dense(neurons: 10, name: "dense1")
		 --> Softmax()
```

Now we can use `resizeLayer` to change the properties of this layer later on (for example, to crop the input image based on face detection).

We can use `conv1Output` to access the tensor. Normally you don't need to keep track of individual tensors, but it's handy for debugging purposes. A tensor writes its data into an `MPSTemporaryImage`, which only exists for a very short while. By setting the tensor's `imageIsTemporary` property to false, it will use a permanent `MPSImage` instead. After the forward pass through the network completes, you can ask the model for this tensor's image and look at its contents. This is useful for making sure your neural network actually computes the right thing.

```
// before compiling:
conv1Output.imageIsTemporary = false

// after inference:
let image = model.image(for: conv1Output, inflightIndex: i)
print(image.toFloatArray())
```

This method of connecting tensors to layers to tensors to layers etc is quite powerful. For example, here's how you can make an Inception module:

```
let avgPool = AveragePooling(kernel: (3, 3), stride: (1, 1), padding: true)

let mixed0 = Concatenate([
  initial --> Convolution(kernel: (1, 1), channels: 64, activation: relu, name: "mixed_conv"),
  initial --> Convolution(kernel: (1, 1), channels: 48, activation: relu, name: "mixed_tower_conv")
          --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 64, activation: relu, name: "mixed_tower_conv_1"),
  initial --> Convolution(kernel: (1, 1), channels: 64, activation: relu, name: "mixed_tower_1_conv")
          --> Convolution(kernel: (3, 3), channels: 96, activation: relu, name: "mixed_tower_1_conv_1")
          --> Convolution(kernel: (3, 3), channels: 96, activation: relu, name: "mixed_tower_1_conv_2"),
  initial --> avgPool
          --> Convolution(kernel: (1, 1), channels: 32, activation: relu, name: "mixed_tower_2_conv")
])
```

The `initial` tensor contains the output from the first part of the network. Here that same tensor is passed into four different layers. The outputs of these layers are concatenated into a new tensor, `mixed0`. The entire Inception-v3 network is built up of such modules. Also note that the `avgPool` layer is stored in a separate variable. That's because this particular layer will be reused throughout the network. You're allowed to use layers on multiple tensors.

### Compiling the model

The `Model` contains the graph you have just defined and is the main interface the rest of your app will be interacting with.

To create the model, you supply both the input and the output tensor:

```
model = Model(input: input, output: output)
```

Once you've created the model you can compile it:

```
let success = model.compile(device: device, inflightBuffers: 3) {
  name, count, type in 
  return ParameterLoaderBundle(name: name, count: count,
                               suffix: type == .weights ? "_W" : "_b",
                               ext: "bin")
}

if success {
  print(model.summary())
}
```

Compiling calculates the sizes of all the tensors, builds all the MPSCNN kernels, loads the parameters, and prepares the neural network for use.

An `MPSCNNConvolution` or `MPSCNNFullyConnected` object needs to know the weights and biases the network has learned during training, so you have to provide these somehow. To this end, `model.compile()` takes a closure that should return a `ParameterData` object.

This closure is called for every layer that takes parameters, once for the weights and once for the biases. The above example returns a `ParameterLoaderBundle` instance, an implementation of `ParameterData` that reads the weights and biases from files stored in the app bundle. For the layer named `"conv1"`, this would load the files **conv1_W.bin** (weights) and **conv1_b.bin** (biases).

Because Forge uses this indirect mechanism for loading weights and biases, you can store them anywhere you want: in multiple smaller files, in one big file, in the asset catalog, in files you downloaded from a server, encrypted, etc. Forge does not force a particular storage type upon you.

After the model successfully compiles, `print(model.summary())` will output a list of all the layers that are in the model. This is useful for double-checking that you specified everything correctly (and that Forge didn't make any mistakes!).

### Running the model

Once you have a compiled model you call `model.encode()` to encode the GPU commands into a Metal `MTLCommandBuffer` object:

```
model.encode(commandBuffer: commandBuffer, texture: inputTexture, inflightIndex: i)
```

This performs a single forward pass of the neural network.

After the command buffer completes executing on the GPU, you can read the neural network's output as follows:

```
let probabilities = model.outputImage(inflightIndex: i).toFloatArray()
let top5 = probabilities.top(k: 5)
let top5Labels = top5.map { x -> (String, Float) in (labels[x.0], x.1) }
```

The `inflightIndex` parameter is used for *triple-buffering*, a mechanism that prevents the CPU and GPU from waiting on each other. This improves throughput so that the CPU can already be encoding the commands for the next video frame while GPU is still working on the previous frame. Forge provides a class `Runner` that takes care of all the CPU-GPU synchronization stuff for you. You can read more about it [in the blog post](http://machinethink.net/blog/forge-neural-network-toolkit-for-metal/).

## Where are the unit tests?

Sorry, Metal does not work on the simulator and Xcode can't run logic tests on the device. Catch-22.

## TODO

#### General

- Improve API documentation
- Add package manager support of some kind
- Add unit tests (should run as a separate app, not as a test target)
- Add more layer types
- Add more examples
- Make a nice logo (use as icon for example apps)

#### DSL

##### Slow compilation?

Sometimes compiling Inception takes 0.5 seconds and other times only about 0.12 seconds (which is similar to the setup time Apple's original Inception code). I wonder what's causing this... (Loading from disk? Creating the MPSCNN objects? Gremlins?)

##### Allow nested concatenation

```
let m1 = Concatenate([a, b])
let m2 = Concatenate([m1, c])
```

Here, tensors `a`, `b`, and `c` should all write into `m2`'s image (`m1` does not get an image). I haven't actually tried to do this yet, but I suspect the `destinationChannelOffset` for `c` would be wrong.

##### Allow "residual" or bypass connections

```
let a = ... 
let b = a --> Convolution()
let c = Concatenate(a, b)
```

Here, tensor `a` writes into `c`'s image (no problem). But `b` will read from `c`'s image and also write to `c`'s image. I haven't tried this yet. It might work, or not...

##### Make compilation more robust / multiple outputs

Currently you can write this:

```
let x = input --> Layer() --> ...
let y = x --> Layer()
let model = Model(input: input, output: x)
```

Here, `y` is an orphaned tensor. It is connected to the graph (and will show up below the last tensor from `x` in the summary) but its `MPSTemporaryImage` is not read by anything, and MPSCNN will throw an error.

One way to fix this is to not pass an explicit output to `Model()` but only the input. Any tensors in the array that don't have a next tensor will be treated as outputs and are given a real `MPSImage` (not a temporary one). The summary should list how many outputs it has found. `model.outputImage()` will take an index (no index means the first output).

Alternatively, just treat this as an error. If a tensor acts as an output but is not explicitly specified as being an output, then something's not right.

##### Reduce encoding overhead

It's not particularly slow as-is, but the less work we do during runtime, the better!

##### Add a compilation mode that outputs source code

The Forge DSL is nice for quickly putting together a neural network. But it can't do *everything* (yet) so for production code you may want to revert to writing "pure" MPSCNN code.

`Model.compile()` could take a flag so that it writes the Swift code for you and dumps it to stdout. Then you just have to copy-paste the code into your project and tweak it to fit your needs. That would save a lot of time!

#### VideoCapture

This should properly handle interruptions from phone calls, FaceTime, going to the background, etc. It is not yet robust enough for production code.

#### Examples

Refactor the examples to share more code. Currently there is a bit of code duplication going on.
