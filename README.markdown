# Forge: a neural network toolkit for Metal

**Forge** is a collection of helper code that makes it a little easier to construct deep neural networks using Apple's MPSCNN framework.

[Read the blog post](http://machinethink.net/blog/forge-neural-network-toolkit-for-metal/)

## What does this do?

Features of Forge:

**Conversion functions.** MPSCNN uses MPSImages and MTLTextures for everything, often using 16-bit floats. But you probably want to work with Swift `[Float]` arrays. These conversion functions make it easy to work with Metal images and textures.

**Easy layer creation.** Reduce the boilerplate when building the layers for your neural network. Using Forge's domain-specific language defining a neural net becomes as simple as:

```swift
model = Model()
        --> Resize(width: 28, height: 28)
        --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 20, filter: relu, name: "conv1")
        --> MaxPooling(kernel: (2, 2), stride: (2, 2))
        --> Convolution(kernel: (5, 5), channels: 50, filter: relu, name: "conv2")
        --> MaxPooling(kernel: (2, 2), stride: (2, 2))
        --> Dense(neurons: 320, filter: relu, name: "fc1")
        --> Dense(neurons: 10, name: "fc2")
        --> Softmax()
```

**Custom layers.** MPSCNN only supports a limited number of layers, so we've added a few of our own:

- Depth-wise convolution
- Deconvolution (coming soon!)

**Preprocessing kernels.** Often you need to preprocess data before it goes into the neural network. Forge comes with a few handy kernels for this:

- SubtractMeanColor
- RGB2Gray
- RGB2BGR
	
**Custom compute kernels.** Many neural networks require custom compute kernels, so Forge provides helpers that make it easy to write and launch your own kernels.

**Debugging tools.** When you implement a neural network in Metal you want to make sure it actually computes the correct thing.

**Example projects.** Forge comes with a number of pretrained neural networks, such as LeNet-5 on MNIST, Inception3 on ImageNet, and MobileNets.

## Run the demo!

To see a demo of Forge in action, open **Forge.xcworkspace** in Xcode and run the **MNIST** app on your device.

You need at least Xcode 8.3 and a device with an A8 processor (iPhone 6 or better) running iOS 10 or later. You cannot build for the simulator as it does not support Metal.

## How to install Forge

Use Xcode 8.3 or better.

1. Copy the **Forge** folder into your project.
2. Use **File > Add Files to "YourProject" > Forge.xcodeproj** to add the Forge project inside your own project.
3. Drag **Products/Forge.framework** into the **Embedded Binaries** section of your project settings.
4. `import Forge` in your code.

NOTE: You cannot build for the simulator, only for "Generic iOS Device" or an actual device with arm64 architecture.

## How to use Forge

[TODO: Instructions coming soon. For now look at the example apps.]

For an example of using the domain-specific language for quickly making new networks, [see the blog post](http://machinethink.net/blog/forge-neural-network-toolkit-for-metal/).

> Tip: The [Caffe2](http://caffe2.ai/) deep learning tool also contains [a bunch of MPSCNN code](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2/tree/master/caffe2/contrib/mpscnn-fb). 

## Where are the unit tests?

Sorry, Metal does not work on the simulator and Xcode can't run logic tests on the device. Catch-22.

## TODO

#### General

- Improve API documentation
- Add package manager support of some kind
- Add unit tests (should run as a separate app, not as a test target)
- Add more layer types
- Add more examples
- Make a nice logo (use as icon for example apps)

#### DSL

- Sometimes compiling Inception takes 0.5 seconds and other times only about 0.12 seconds (which is similar to the setup time Apple's original Inception code). I wonder what's causing this...
- Reuse the pooling layer MPSCNN objects.

#### VideoCapture

This should properly handle interruptions from phone calls, FaceTime, going to the background, etc. It is not yet robust enough for production code.

#### Examples

Refactor the examples to share more code. Currently there is a bit of code duplication going on.
