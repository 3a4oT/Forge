  Depth-wise convolution
  
  Applies a different convolution kernel to each input channel. Only a single
  kernel is applied to each input channel and so the number of output channels
  is the same as the number of input channels.

  A depth-wise convolution only performs filtering; it doesn't combine channels
  to create new features like a regular convolution does.

    Creates a new DepthwiseConvolution object.

    - Parameters:
      - channelMultiplier: If this is M, then each input channel has M kernels 
        applied to it, resulting in M output channels for each input channel.
        Default is 1.
      - relu: If true, applies a ReLU to the output. Default is false.
      - kernelWeights: The weights should be arranged in memory like this:
        `[kernelHeight][kernelWidth][featureChannels]`. There is no bias for
        this kind of layer.
